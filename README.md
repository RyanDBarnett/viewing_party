## Project Board

[Viewing Parties Github Project Board](https://github.com/RyanDBarnett/viewing_party/projects/1)

## Description

Viewing party is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for the user and friend's. This one week project is a collaboration between [Adam Etzion](https://github.com/aetzion1), [Phil McCarthy](https://github.com/philmccarthy), and [Ryan Barnett](https://github.com/RyanDBarnett).

## Work Process

We utilized a [project board](https://github.com/RyanDBarnett/viewing_party/projects/1) to divide our work into small tasks. These tasks were then assigned to pairs or individuals. Once the task was completed the assignee would make a pull request and a different team member would review the pull request and merge it if it passed review.

## Setup

1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:create`

## Versions

- Ruby 2.5.3
